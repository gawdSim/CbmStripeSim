 * Description:
 *     This is the interface file for parsing the command line args for cbm sim. 
 *     It includes the constants, enums, and functions required to parse the command
 *     line arguments according to a two-mode scheme for building simulations (i.e.
 *     creating new rabbits) and running simulations (i.e. training rabbits).
